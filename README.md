Archetypical
============

Archetypical is codeigniter(https://ellislab.com/codeigniter) project that's gonna be a simple and basic Astrology program for calculating Astrological Birth charts. 

It uses PHP-SWEPH and the swissephemeris, which both can be found on https://code.google.com/p/php-sweph/ and http://astro.com

PHP-SWEPH is a PHP extension to Astrodienst Swiss Ephemeris library, which returns data that allows us to the basic Astrological calculations.

At the moment its uses google maps for finding the timezone and latitudes and longitudes given for a specific place.
