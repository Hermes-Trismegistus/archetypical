Archetypical
============

Archetypical is codeigniter(https://ellislab.com/codeigniter) project that's gonna be a simple and basic Astrology program for calculating Astrological Birth charts inside a web browser. In the future it's gonna have options to also calculate transits, progression, solar horoscopes etc. 

It uses PHP-SWEPH and the swissephemeris, which both can be found on https://code.google.com/p/php-sweph/ and http://astro.com

PHP-SWEPH is a PHP extension to Astrodienst Swiss Ephemeris library, which returns data that allows us to do the basic or advanced Astrological calculations.

At the moment it also uses google maps api for finding the timezone and latitudes and longitudes given for a specific place. Maybe In the future it will include alternatives.
